Second person Birds

When we look at birds, we wanna fly. And to fly and soar, we must be light hearted.
I think it's the evolutionary next stage, we as humans would like to achieve - to be birds ourselves.
So many super heroes and powers are related to the fascination with flying.

And while there might be a long way to go before we achieve our superhero dreams. We must lighten ourselves, unburden the heaviness. 

And that's where our friends- First Person Birds come in.

I hereby officially define First Person Birds, they are the light feathered, soft hearted people who chirrup melody into your life. They tweet about their pecking, feathering and collecting food, and we seem to derive a certain kind of pleasure in those banalities, and their musings.

And from them we learn to express ourselves and lighten you heart. And by surrounding ourselves with the flock, we become second person birds.
