Totems: Prompt from IndieWebClub Meet

Inception movie watcher would have wondered once about what their totem's going to be, a dice, a ring, a coin.

I have totems for some aspects of my life, a personal marker to indicate whether life is going good, bad or am in a slump.

For example, when I am sick, I get yellow flashes in my eyes signalling my body to rest.
For when I am emotionally well regulated, I call my mom, to spend energy and give back to the world, as I know my mom waits for me to call her.
For when I am really sad and low, I laugh at the smallest joke with utmost excitement and happiness, because we try to grab anything we can from sinking.

I'd like to define more totems for myself to become more self-aware, what do I want? What makes me happy? What are my adventures like?

And the scale of how the dice tilts or what it lands on. Maybe I'll publish them here on the next blog post and make an automation to make a journal entry back in my Obsidian, a two way street.


In a truly fictitious world, I'd like to have two stones like Paulo Coelho's Alchemist protagonist to make the choice for me when I am paralysed. A black stone saying Yes and a white stone saying No.


In the world of deception,
Every idea, every inception,
We seek a home of warm reception,
Longing for the human touch, 
Our hands reaching, asking if it's too much?
How did it all happen such and such?
Maybe DesCartes was right,
Maybe our mind is our sight,
Our souls are our might,
The living totems.
